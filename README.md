# PDB_Hydrogen_bond_analysis


Author: Amirhossein Saali


## Project Overview

This project is aimed to find moderate hydrogen bond in original pdb structures available in protein data bank. Moreover, this code will give you statistical information and various graphs to have a better understanding about the available moderate hydrogen bond in pdb structure.


To run this program, you will need to run and insert the pdb id. following graphical result will be provided:


- #### Single Snapshots: 

 This plot is the sample of ten individual snapshots generated by this graph.

- #### Bar Charts: 


 Bar chart is showing the number of hydrogen bonds in each individual snapshot.
